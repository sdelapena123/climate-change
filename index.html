    <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most abundant particle on
      Earth. It is a major greenhouse gas that is naturally
      in the Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide affect climate change by the usage of
      fossil fuels, extreme weather events, trapping the
      Earth's heat, rising sea levels, melting ice glaciers, harming marine wildlife, and
      deforestation. These facts are important to note as there
      have been an increasing level of carbon dioxide levels over
      the years. 

    <h2>Fossil Fuel Usage</h2>
    <p>Carbon dioxide is mostly caused by burning an immense
      amount of fossil fuels, which are many things such as
      coal, oil, and gas. It accounts "for over 75 per cent of
      global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent
      of all carbon dioxide emissions.
      Many people go through fossil fuels
      quickly with the amount of cars." <a class ="link", href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/">(Columbia Climate School)</a>

    <p></p>

    <div class="weather-events">
    <h2>Weather Events</h2>
    <p>Carbon dioxide can cause many major weather events. According to&nbsp<a class="link" ,
        href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/">NASA</a>, these are 
        the weather events that may happen.
      <ul>
        <li>• Marine Heat Waves</li>
        <li>• Wildfires</li>
        <li>• Droughts</li>
        <li>• Tropical Cyclones</li>
        <li>• Floods</li>
        <li>• High-Tide Flooding</li>
        <li>• Heat Extremes</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>It is said that these extreme weather events will escalate even 
      further the more that the Earth's temperature warms up 
      due to climate change. This is why there are many people around 
      the world that is advocating to helping reduce the Earth's temperature 
      to not reach a doom's day like scenario.
    </p>

    <h2>Carbon Dioxide's Trapping Heat</h2>
    <p>The main thing that carbon dioxide does it to trap heat on Earth. 
      How this exactly happens is that "When sunlight reaches Earth, 
      the surface absorbs some of the light's energy and reradiates 
      it as infrared waves, which we feel as heat. These infrared 
      waves travel up into the atmosphere and will escape back 
      into space if unimpeded."&nbsp;<a class="link", href="https://

    <h2>Impact of Carbon Dioxide on Rising Sea Levels</h2>
    <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly contributes to rising sea levels through its role in climate change.
      As CO2 levels in the atmosphere increase, they trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise—a
      phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This warming leads to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers,
      which directly contributes to higher sea levels. Additionally, the warming of oceans causes water to expand,
      further raising sea levels. The rise in sea levels has far-reaching impacts on coastal communities, ecosystems,
      and infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Key reasons why carbon dioxide impacts rising sea levels:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Melting of polar ice caps and glaciers:</strong> Higher temperatures cause ice to melt, adding more
        water to the oceans.</li>
      <li><strong>Thermal expansion of seawater:</strong> As ocean water warms, it expands, contributing to rising sea
        levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Disruption of natural carbon cycles:</strong> Excess CO2 affects carbon storage in oceans, increasing
        the amount of CO2 that contributes to warming.</li>
      <li><strong>Changes in precipitation patterns:</strong> CO2-driven climate shifts affect weather patterns,
        influencing the flow of water into the oceans and exacerbating rising sea levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact of Melting Glaciers Caused by CO2</h2>
    <p>The melting of glaciers caused by the increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is a direct consequence
      of global warming.
      As CO2 levels rise due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, more heat is trapped in the Earth's
      atmosphere, causing global
      temperatures to climb. This warming accelerates the melting of glaciers, particularly in polar regions and
      high-altitude areas,
      where ice sheets are shrinking at alarming rates. The loss of glaciers contributes to rising sea levels, as the
      melted ice flows into
      the ocean. Additionally, the melting of glaciers can disrupt local ecosystems that depend on the cold, freshwater
      environments
      glaciers provide, affecting both wildlife and human communities. Moreover, glaciers play a role in reflecting
      sunlight, so their
      reduction exposes more dark land or water, which absorbs more heat and exacerbates the warming effect, creating a
      feedback loop
      that further accelerates the melting process.</p>

    <h2>Key Facts About Melting Glaciers and CO2:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Rising CO2 levels trap heat in the atmosphere, causing temperatures to
        increase and glaciers to melt faster.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> Melting glaciers contribute to higher sea levels by releasing water into
        the oceans.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Glaciers provide vital freshwater to ecosystems, and their loss impacts
        plant and animal species dependent on cold, freshwater habitats.</li>
      <li><strong>Reflection of Sunlight:</strong> Glaciers reflect sunlight, helping cool the Earth. As they melt, more
        dark land or water is exposed, absorbing more heat and accelerating warming.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> The reduction of glaciers leads to more heat absorption by the Earth's
        surface, which then accelerates global warming, causing further melting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact of Carbon Dioxide on Harming Marine Life</h2>

    <p>The rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere not only contribute to global warming but also have
      detrimental effects on marine life.
      As CO2 is absorbed by oceans, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, leading to ocean acidification. This
      process lowers the pH of the water,
      disrupting the ability of marine organisms, such as corals, shellfish, and plankton, to form calcium carbonate
      shells and skeletons. Ocean acidification
      weakens these organisms, which are crucial to marine ecosystems, and threatens biodiversity. Additionally, the
      warming of the oceans, driven by increased
      CO2, disrupts marine habitats, endangers species, and affects the food chain. As ocean conditions change, it
      becomes harder for marine life to survive and
      thrive, posing a threat to both ocean health and the communities that depend on marine resources.</p>

    <h2>Key Facts About CO2's Impact on Marine Life:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> CO2 absorbed by the oceans forms carbonic acid, lowering the water's pH
        and affecting marine life that relies on calcium carbonate.</li>
      <li><strong>Coral Bleaching:</strong> Higher CO2 levels increase sea temperatures, stressing coral reefs, leading
        to bleaching and weakening coral ecosystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Weakened Shellfish:</strong> Acidic waters interfere with the ability of shellfish, like oysters and
        mussels, to form protective shells.</li>
      <li><strong>Disrupted Food Chain:</strong> Ocean acidification and temperature changes can reduce the availability
        of plankton, which are a primary food source for many marine species.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> The combination of acidification and warming disrupts habitats, putting
        a wide range of marine species at risk of extinction.</li>
    </ul>
